# Climate Time_Series_Analysis
This is a simple python code which uses scipy and statsmodel to analyze the climate variables in time series. The code can be used to detemine the auto correlation time associated with the best fitting model. Some background knowledge can be found in the wiki page. The sample input data is the monthly mean interim temperature data from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The data is stored as matlab .mat file.
