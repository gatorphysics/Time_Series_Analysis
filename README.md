# Climate Time Series Analysis
This is a simple python code which uses scipy and statsmodel to analyze the climate variables in time series. The code can be used to detemine the auto correlation time associated with the best fitting model. Some background knowledge can be found in the wiki page. The sample input data is the monthly mean temperature or humidity data from publicly available data sets including ERA-Interim data of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and MERRA (MODERN-ERA RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS FOR RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS)data of NASA. The data is stored as matlab .mat file.
